### Hi there 👋

I am 16 years old, currently studying at school and will be a **doctor** or **software developer** in the future.
My curiosity about software came from childhood and i'm looking forward to learning new programming languages.
I am mostly a **web-based** developer. **Back-end** is indispensable.
